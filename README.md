Notes about our fork:
* We do not use iniDB, iniDB code may not be updated or merged. 
* We use extDB, initially provided by @Torndeco and improved by TOPArma


We are not a support team. We are a community that enjoys playing arma and saw fit to modify our own A3Wasteland mission file. 

GWIGaming.com ArmA 3 Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival. Our main objective is to fight over a group of flags, which consist of 1-4 capture points. This fork
of A3Wasteland is primarily focused on balance and strives to maximize player interaction at every turn.
